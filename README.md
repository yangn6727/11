# Nanyang Yang, PhD

## About Me

I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Chemistry at University X. My research interests include computational chemistry, materials science, and quantum mechanics. I received my PhD in Chemistry from University Y in 2021, where I worked on developing computational methods for modeling chemical reactions.

## Research

My current research focuses on developing computational models for predicting the properties of complex materials, such as zeolites and metal-organic frameworks. I use quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations to understand the behavior of these materials under different conditions. In addition, I am also interested in studying the catalytic properties of these materials for various applications.
